## 🎯 The Critical Problem We're Solving

Rwanda's government decision-makers face a **data intelligence gap** that costs weeks of delays and billions in missed opportunities:

### Current Reality:
- 📊 **65+ NISR datasets** scattered across the Microdata Portal
- 📧 **Policy briefs lost** in email threads and ministry silos
- ⏱️ **2-3 weeks** to answer simple questions like *"What's our youth unemployment rate in Kigali?"*
- 🔄 **Repeated policy mistakes** due to lack of institutional memory
- 💰 **Investment opportunities missed** because investors can't access reliable government data

### Real-World Impact:
> *"A minister needs to reallocate budget to Eastern Province poverty programs, but it takes 2 weeks to get NISR EICV7 data, analyze it, and generate a briefing. By then, the budget window has closed."*

**Our platform solves this in 30 seconds.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution: Rwanda's First AI-Powered Government Intelligence OS

A **comprehensive intelligence platform** that transforms how Rwanda's government uses NISR data for decision-making:

### 🎯 What It Does:
1. **Centralizes all NISR datasets** in one searchable, AI-powered platform
2. **Answers policy questions instantly** with citations to official NISR sources
3. **Generates executive briefs** (poverty analysis, employment trends, GDP reports) in seconds
4. **Tracks institutional memory** to learn from past policy successes and failures
5. **Connects investors** to verified government opportunities with real data
6. **Monitors cross-ministry performance** with NISR-backed KPIs

### 🚀 Think of it as:
**"Bloomberg Terminal + ChatGPT + Palantir"** — purpose-built for Rwanda's government using official NISR data.
