## 🎯 Problem Statement

Rwanda's government leaders face a **critical decision-making bottleneck**: data scattered across ministries, PDFs lost in email threads, and weeks of delay to answer simple questions like:
- *"What's our current poverty rate in Eastern Province?"*
- *"Which sectors are creating the most jobs?"*
- *"How do our GDP growth projections look?"*

**Result:** Slow policy responses, missed opportunities, duplicated efforts.

---

## 💡 Solution

An **AI-powered intelligence dashboard** that:
1. **Centralizes NISR data** (poverty, labor, GDP, demographics) in one searchable platform
2. **Answers questions instantly** using AI chat with NISR citations
3. **Generates reports** (budget briefs, ministry performance, project status) with one click
4. **Tracks cross-ministry intelligence** (resource allocation, opportunities, risks)

**Think of it as:** Rwanda's government getting a "ChatGPT for national statistics" + executive dashboard in one platform.
