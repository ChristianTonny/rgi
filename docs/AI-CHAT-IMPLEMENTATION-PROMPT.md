# 🤖 AI Chat Implementation with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash - Complete Guide

## 📋 Project Context
You are implementing a **fully functional AI chat assistant** for the **Rwanda Government Intelligence Platform**. This is a decision intelligence platform that helps government officials analyze NISR (National Institute of Statistics Rwanda) data, track projects, manage budgets, and identify investment opportunities.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Replace the current template-based AI chat system with a **real AI-powered chat** using **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (newest model)** that can:
- Answer questions about government data intelligently
- Provide NISR data insights with proper citations
- Analyze budgets, projects, and opportunities
- Maintain conversation context
- Show source attribution for all data-driven responses

---

## 🔐 Security Requirements

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: API Key Security
**The Google AI API key is stored in `server/.env` and MUST NEVER be exposed to the frontend or committed to Git.**

```env
# server/.env (ALREADY CONFIGURED - DO NOT CHANGE)
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC5aKUs451K9APZCaZEgDew_QsTozsqeR4
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

**Security Rules:**
1. ✅ API calls to Gemini MUST happen on the **backend only** (Express.js server)
2. ✅ Frontend sends user messages to `/api/ai/chat` endpoint
3. ✅ Backend makes Gemini API calls using `process.env.GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`
4. ❌ NEVER send API key to frontend
5. ❌ NEVER hardcode API key in source code
6. ✅ Add `server/.env` to `.gitignore` (already done)

## 🏗️ Current System Architecture

### Existing Files

#### Frontend: `src/components/ai/ai-assistant.tsx`
**Current State:**
- React component with chat UI
- Sends messages to `/api/ai/chat` endpoint
- Displays conversation history
- Shows suggested questions
- **Issues to Fix:**
  - Timestamp error: `message.timestamp.toLocaleTimeString is not a function`
  - Using template-based responses instead of real AI

#### Backend: `server/routes/ai.js`
**Current State:**
- Express.js route handler
- Uses keyword matching with template responses
- Returns mock responses like:
  ```javascript
  {
    success: true,
    data: {
      id: 'msg-123',
      role: 'ASSISTANT',
      content: 'Template response...',
      timestamp: new Date(),
      sources: [...]
    }
  }
  ```

#### NISR Data Access: `server/utils/nisr-loader.js`
**Available Functions:**
- `hasNISRData()` - Check if NISR data is loaded
- `getDashboardStats()` - Get poverty, GDP, labor statistics
- Returns data like:
  ```javascript
  {
    poverty: { nationalRate: 38.2, source: 'EICV7', year: 2024 },
    gdp: { totalGrowth: 8.2, bySector: {...}, source: 'National Accounts' },
    labor: { unemploymentRate: 15.3, youthUnemployment: 23.4, source: 'RLFS' }
  }
  ```

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Requirements

### Step 1: Install Google Generative AI SDK

```bash
cd server
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

### Step 2: Update Backend AI Route (`server/routes/ai.js`)

**Requirements:**
1. Import and initialize Gemini SDK:
   ```javascript
   const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require('@google/generative-ai');
   const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY);
   ```

2. Use **Gemini 2.5 Flash model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`

3. Define **system instructions** to set AI personality:
   ```
   You are an intelligent assistant for the Rwanda Government Intelligence Platform.
   You help government officials analyze NISR data, track projects, manage budgets,
   and identify investment opportunities. Always cite NISR sources when providing
   statistics. Be professional, concise, and data-driven.
   ```

4. Implement **chat endpoint** (`POST /api/ai/chat`):
   - Accept `{ message, conversationHistory }` from frontend
   - Build conversation history for context
   - Include NISR data in prompt context when available
   - Call Gemini API with multi-turn chat
   - Parse response and extract citations
   - Return structured response matching existing format

5. **Handle NISR Data Integration:**
   - Load NISR stats using `getDashboardStats()`
   - Include relevant data in system prompt or user context
   - When user asks about poverty/GDP/unemployment, reference actual NISR data
   - Example prompt injection:
     ```
     Available NISR Data (use this to answer questions):
     - Poverty Rate: 38.2% (NISR EICV7 2024)
     - GDP Growth: 8.2% (NISR National Accounts 2024)
     - Youth Unemployment: 23.4% (NISR RLFS 2024)
     ```

6. **Response Format:**
   ```javascript
   {
     success: true,
     data: {
       id: `msg-${Date.now()}`,
       role: 'ASSISTANT',
       content: 'AI-generated response...',
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(), // ← Must be ISO string
       sources: [
         {
           id: 'nisr-1',
           name: 'NISR EICV7 (2024)',
           type: 'DATA',
           lastUpdated: new Date(),
           reliability: 95
         }
       ],
       dataSource: 'NISR' // or 'AI' for general questions
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Fix Frontend Timestamp Issue (`src/components/ai/ai-assistant.tsx`)

**Current Bug:**
```typescript
// Line 220 - ERROR: timestamp is ISO string, not Date object
{message.timestamp.toLocaleTimeString()}
```

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// When receiving assistant message (line ~112):
const assistantMessage: AIMessage = {
  ...data.data,
  timestamp: new Date(data.data.timestamp) // ← Convert ISO string to Date
}

// When displaying (line ~220):
{new Date(message.timestamp).toLocaleTimeString()} // ← Safely convert
```

### Step 4: Update Suggested Questions Endpoint (`GET /api/ai/suggestions`)

**Make suggestions dynamic based on NISR data availability:**
```javascript
router.get('/suggestions', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
  const nisrStats = getDashboardStats();

  const suggestions = hasNISRData() ? [
    "What's the current poverty rate in Rwanda?",
    "How is youth unemployment trending?",
    "Show me GDP growth by sector",
    "Which provinces have the highest poverty rates?",
    "What are the top investment opportunities?"
  ] : [
    "Show me projects at risk",
    "What's our budget efficiency?",
    "Top investment opportunities"
  ];

  return res.json({ success: true, data: suggestions });
});
```

## 🎨 User Experience Requirements

### Chat Flow
1. User opens AI assistant (already works)
2. User sees **smart suggested questions** based on NISR data
3. User types or clicks a question
4. **Frontend** sends to `POST /api/ai/chat` with conversation history
5. **Backend** calls Gemini API with:
   - System instructions (AI role)
   - NISR data context
   - Conversation history
   - User's new message
6. Gemini generates intelligent response
7. Backend parses response, adds NISR sources if data was cited
8. Frontend displays response with:
   - AI message content
   - Source citations (if applicable)
   - Timestamp (formatted correctly)

### Error Handling
- Network errors → Show friendly message: "I'm having trouble connecting. Please try again."
- API rate limits → "I'm a bit overwhelmed right now. Please wait a moment."
- Invalid token → Auto-logout (already implemented)
- Gemini API errors → Log to console, show user-friendly error

### Response Quality
- Responses should be **concise** (2-4 sentences for simple questions)
- Use **bullet points** for lists
- Include **NISR citations** when providing statistics
- Maintain **conversation context** (remember previous messages)
- Be **professional** but approachable
