# User Journey & Strategic Alignment

This narrative ties together the platform vision, user flows, and required capabilities. It answers the guiding strategy questions provided and documents how the current feature set supports each objective.

---

## 1. What do I want to achieve?
- Build a government-grade decision intelligence platform that unifies data, analytics, and AI assistance to accelerate Rwanda’s development goals.
- Deliver seamless user journeys for ministers, policy directors, programme managers, and external partners (entrepreneurs/investors), enabling them to move from insight to action within a single workspace.
- Operationalise institutional memory and cross-ministry coordination with real-time metrics, guided workflows, and auditability.

## 2. Is this project aligned with my long-term vision?
- Yes. The initiative aligns with the long-term aspiration to modernise public sector decision-making through data and AI. It positions the creator as a leader in civic technology for the African continent, building reusable patterns that can scale to other governments.
- The roadmap partners technical excellence (Convex, Next.js, AI orchestration) with policy impact, reinforcing both career growth and mission-driven objectives.

## 3. What skills do I have that can contribute to this project?
- Full-stack product development (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind) for crafting responsive, role-aware interfaces.
- Backend/API design and data modelling (Convex, Express heritage) to power real-time analytics and secure data flows.
- AI integration expertise (Gemini) for context-aware assistants and automated recommendations.
- Strategic product thinking: mapping user journeys, documenting functional gaps, and ensuring interoperability across modules.

## 4. What resources do I need?
- **Technical:** Convex backend infrastructure, hosting/CI pipelines, Gemini API access, design system assets, analytics instrumentation.
- **Data:** Access to ministry budgets, project portfolios, opportunity pipelines, policy documents, and institutional lessons.
- **People:** Collaboration with government stakeholders, domain experts for validation, design partners for UX polish.
- **Funding:** Budget for API usage (AI), hosting, and potential staffing (data engineers, designers, QA).

## 5. Who is my target audience?
- **Primary:** Government leadership—Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, Policy Directors—needing timely intelligence and coordinated action.
- **Secondary:** Programme managers, analysts, and data teams who supply inputs and monitor execution.
- **External:** Entrepreneurs and investors engaging with government opportunities, requiring a trusted interface to discover incentives and express interest.

## 6. What problem am I solving?
- Fragmented data silos, slow policy execution, and limited institutional memory hinder informed decisions.
- Lack of unified workspace for budget oversight, project risk monitoring, and opportunity matchmaking.
- Need for AI-augmented workflows that contextualise insights with historical patterns and real-time metrics.

## 7. What are the potential risks and challenges?
- **Data availability/quality:** Access to accurate government datasets may be delayed or inconsistent.
- **Security & privacy:** Handling sensitive government information requires rigorous governance, RBAC, and auditing.
- **Adoption resistance:** Change management within ministries may slow uptake; workflows must align with existing processes.
- **Technical scope creep:** Balancing rich feature set with maintainable architecture necessitates clear prioritisation and phased delivery.
- **AI reliability:** Gemini responses must be grounded in verifiable data to maintain trust.

## 8. How will I measure success?
- Platform usage analytics: daily active users across key personas, session duration, task completion rates.
- Operational KPIs: reduction in decision-cycle time, number of risks mitigated, budget reallocation turnaround, opportunities matched.
- Qualitative feedback: satisfaction scores from ministers, policy teams, and entrepreneurs.
- Delivery milestones: completion of Convex-backed modules, AI assistant accuracy benchmarks, onboarding of additional ministries.

## 9. What is my timeline?
- **Phase 1 (0-3 months):** Migrate dashboard/intelligence modules to Convex, implement core user journeys (dashboard, intelligence, opportunities, projects, ministries). Establish AI assistant with live data.
- **Phase 2 (3-6 months):** Expand tabs (analytics, institutional memory, action center), integrate tasking, notifications, and cross-module search. Harden security and audit trails.
- **Phase 3 (6-12 months):** Scale to additional ministries, add data ingestion automations, refine AI-guided planning, prepare for broader government rollout.

## 10. Am I passionate about this project?
- Absolutely. The project marries civic impact with cutting-edge technology, aligning with a commitment to build systems that empower governments and citizens. The documented reviews and architectural plans reflect a sustained enthusiasm for crafting a world-class intelligence platform.

## User Journey Highlights
- **Minister persona:** Logs into dashboard → reviews resource allocation → drills into project risks → assigns actions → consults AI assistant for cross-ministry insights.
- **Policy director:** Navigates Intelligence tab → studies institutional memory → generates analytics report → archives lessons learned.
- **Entrepreneur:** Applies filters on Opportunities tab → reviews incentives → expresses interest → tracked by ministry leads.
- **Programme manager:** Operates in Projects tab → updates milestones → monitors risk alerts → syncs with ministry KPIs.
- **Administrator:** Uses proposed Admin/Action Center tabs to manage data taxonomies, tasks, and audit logs.

These journeys inform the functionality captured in the other review documents, ensuring each workflow is supported end-to-end within the Convex-powered platform.
