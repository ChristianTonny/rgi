## üö® Critical Changes That Affect Your Strategy

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Team Formation Rules (MAJOR CONSTRAINT)

**Previous Understanding**:
- Form team of 2 from any university

**NEW REALITY** (from meeting):
- **Students**: MUST be team of EXACTLY 2 (both must be current students with student cards)
- **Fresh Graduates (2024-2025)**: Must participate INDIVIDUALLY (no teams allowed)
- **Mixed teams NOT permitted** (can't have 1 student + 1 graduate)

**IMPACT ON YOU**:
```
DECISION REQUIRED:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ Are you a CURRENT STUDENT or FRESH GRADUATE?       ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ                                                      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ OPTION A: Current Student                          ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   ‚Üí Find 1 student teammate (exact 2-person team)  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   ‚Üí Evaluation: Team-based                         ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   ‚Üí Prize: Laptops for both + potential internship ‚îÇ

### 2. üé• Demo Video Requirements (CHANGED FORMAT)

**Previous Understanding**:
- 3-5 minute demo video with voiceover explaining features

**NEW REALITY** (from meeting):
- **Screen recording WITHOUT voiceover**
- Just show the application working (silent demo)
- Recommended tool: Chrome extension "Screen Castify"

**IMPACT ON YOU**:
- **DON'T record voiceover pitch** like we planned
- **DO record clean screen capture** of:
  1. Login flow
  2. Dashboard loading with data
  3. AI assistant answering questions
  4. Clicking through features (search, export, modals)
  5. Mobile responsiveness (resize browser)
- **Keep it short**: 2-3 minutes showing core workflows
- **Add text overlays** if needed to explain steps (since no voiceover)

**NEW VIDEO SCRIPT**:
```
[0:00-0:10] Title screen: "Rwanda Gov Intelligence Platform"
[0:10-0:30] Login ‚Üí Dashboard view (show data cards)
[0:30-1:00] AI Assistant: Type question ‚Üí Get NISR-backed answer
[1:00-1:30] Click project ‚Üí Detail modal ‚Üí Export CSV
[1:30-2:00] Search "infrastructure" ‚Üí See results ‚Üí Navigate
[2:00-2:30] Resize to mobile view ‚Üí Show responsiveness
[2:30-2:45] GitHub repo view (show code structure)
[2:45-3:00] End screen with GitHub URL
```

---

### 3. üì¶ Submission Requirements (MORE SPECIFIC)

**NEW MANDATORY ITEMS** (from meeting):

#### GitHub Repository MUST Contain:
1. ‚úÖ **README.md** - Explain dashboard functionality (we have this)
2. ‚úÖ **Code scripts** - All source code (we have this)
3. ‚úÖ **Screen-recorded demo video** - NO voiceover (need to record)
4. ‚úÖ **Dataset files used** - NISR CSVs/Excel files (need to add)
5. üìù **Optional but recommended**: requirements.txt (Python) or package.json (Node) listing dependencies

**CRITICAL**: Repository must be **PUBLIC** at submission time.

**ACTION ITEMS**:
```bash
# Add to your repo before October 10:

1. /data/nisr-datasets/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poverty-index-eicv-2023.csv
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ labor-force-survey-2024.xlsx
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ national-accounts-gdp.csv
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (explain data sources)

2. /demo/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hackathon-demo-video.mp4 (screen recording, no voiceover)

3. requirements.txt OR package.json (already have this)
```

---

### 4. üéØ Judging Criteria (CLARIFIED PRIORITIES)

**Previous Understanding**:
- Generic evaluation criteria

**NEW EMPHASIS** (from meeting):
- **Functionality > Aesthetics** (judges care about "does it work" more than "does it look pretty")
- **Story flow & storyline** (how you guide users through the app)
- **Creativity & originality** (plagiarism = instant disqualification)
- **Relevance to topics** (must tie to Track 5 objectives)
- **Data presentation quality** (how well you show NISR data)

**IMPACT ON YOU**:
- ‚úÖ **GOOD NEWS**: You have functionality (60-65% complete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **FOCUS AREA**: Ensure demo shows clear "story" (problem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí impact)
- ‚úÖ **ALREADY STRONG**: Creativity (AI + institutional memory is unique)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS WORK**: Make sure NISR data is VISIBLE in the app (not just mentioned)

**STRATEGIC SHIFT**:
```
OLD PRIORITY: Make it look beautiful
NEW PRIORITY: Make the story crystal clear

Demo Story Arc:
1. Problem: Minister needs to allocate 500M RWF (show urgency)
2. Solution: Ask AI assistant (show NISR data being used)
3. Result: Get instant recommendation (show decision confidence)
4. Impact: Repeat 2-3 times to show versatility
```

---

### 5. üìä Data Access & Usage (NEW PROCESS)

**NEW INFORMATION** (from meeting):

#### How to Get NISR Data:
1. Visit: NISR website ‚Üí Data Portals ‚Üí NISR Microdata
2. **Create account** (register on portal)
3. Write **brief research description** (e.g., "Building AI-powered government decision platform for hackathon")
4. Wait for **download approval** (may take 1-2 days)
5. Download in: Excel, SPSS, or Stata format (CSV conversion available)
6. **JSON NOT available** (you'll need to convert CSV to JSON if needed)

**FORMATS AVAILABLE**:
- ‚úÖ Excel (.xlsx) - easiest for us
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SPSS (.sav) - need conversion tool
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stata (.dta) - need conversion tool
- ‚ùå JSON - not offered, must convert yourself
- ‚úÖ CSV - can convert from Excel

**ACTION**:
```
URGENT (Do in next 48 hours):
1. Register account at NISR Microdata portal
2. Request access to:
   - Poverty Index (EICV 2023)
   - Labor Force Survey (latest)
   - National Accounts (GDP data)
3. Download as Excel
4. Convert to CSV for your Express API
5. Add to /data/nisr-datasets/ folder in repo
```

**IMPORTANT**: Meeting notes say "multiple data sources encouraged beyond NISR" - so you CAN supplement with World Bank, open data, etc.

---

### 6. ‚è∞ Timeline Reality Check

**CRITICAL DATES**:
- Sept 24: Preparatory session (already happened)
- **October 10**: Submission deadline (NOT Oct 15!)
- **From Sept 24 = 16 days remaining**
- **From today (Oct 1) = 9 DAYS REMAINING** üö®

**REALISTIC TIMELINE**:
```
Days 1-2 (Oct 1-2):
  - Get NISR data access
  - Download datasets
  - Add to repo

Days 3-5 (Oct 3-5):
  - Integrate NISR data into Express API
  - Make sure AI responses cite NISR data
  - Test data flows

Days 6-7 (Oct 6-7):
  - Record screen demo (no voiceover)
  - Polish UI (make data visible)
  - Test all features

Days 8-9 (Oct 8-9):
  - Final testing
  - Update README for hackathon

```
IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Register at NISR Microdata portal TODAY
2. Request: Poverty Index, Labor Force, GDP data
3. Wait for approval (1-2 days)
4. Download Excel files
5. Convert to CSV
6. Add to /data/nisr-datasets/ folder
7. Update Express API to load these files
```

#### 4. Judging Focus (ADJUSTED)
```
EMPHASIZE:
- Functionality (show it works, not just looks pretty)
- Clear story flow (problem ‚Üí AI solution ‚Üí impact)
- NISR data VISIBLE in app (not hidden in backend)
- Originality (AI + institutional memory = unique)

DE-EMPHASIZE:
- Complex animations (judges don't care)
- Marketing pitch (not needed in demo)
- Future roadmap (focus on what works NOW)
```

## üí¨ UPDATED ELEVATOR PITCH (For README)

**OLD VERSION** (3 minutes with roadmap):
> "We built Rwanda's AI-powered decision intelligence platform... [long explanation] ...we plan to scale to 19 ministries, then districts, then Kenya..."

**NEW VERSION** (30 seconds, hackathon-focused):
> "Government officials wait weeks for reports to make decisions. We built an AI assistant that answers policy questions instantly using NISR data. Minister asks: 'Where should I allocate 500M RWF?' AI responds: 'Bugesera district‚ÄîNISR shows 42% poverty rate, our model predicts 15% improvement if funded.' Weeks to seconds. NISR data to action. Built for NST2 governance goals."

**Key Changes**:
- Shorter (judges will skim)
- NISR-first (emphasize data usage)
- Concrete example (show, don't tell)
- NST2 mention (relevance to national goals)
