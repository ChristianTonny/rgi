## üìã YOUR MISSION

You are going to implement all 22 requirements for the Rwanda Government Intelligence Platform in **demo-ready** style. You have **1 day** to complete this.

---

## üìñ STEP 1: READ THESE DOCUMENTS IN ORDER

**CRITICAL:** Read these 3 documents IN THIS EXACT ORDER before writing any code:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ First: `docs/CODEBASE-ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Purpose:** Learn the current codebase structure
**What to look for:**
- Where every file lives
- What's already implemented (‚úÖ) vs placeholder (‚ùå)
- How authentication works
- How API endpoints are structured
- What components already exist
- Database status (PostgreSQL schema defined but NOT connected)
- Convex status (defined but NOT deployed/used)

**Key Sections to Focus On:**
- üó∫Ô∏è PROJECT STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
- üéØ CRITICAL FILES TO UNDERSTAND
- üîå BACKEND API REFERENCE
- üß© COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE
- üö® CRITICAL RULES (DO/DON'T)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second: `docs/product-brief.md`
**Purpose:** Understand the product vision
**What to look for:**
- Target users (Ministers, Policy Directors, Entrepreneurs)
- Core features for each tab
- Product vision (Palantir √ó Bloomberg for Rwanda)
- Data strategy (NISR integration)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Third: `docs/DEMO-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md`
**Purpose:** Get implementation instructions
**What to look for:**
- All 22 requirements with detailed specs
- Mock vs Real implementation strategy
- Loading state patterns
- Demo flow optimization
- Time allocation (1-day plan)

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 2: CONFIRM YOU UNDERSTAND

After reading all 3 documents, respond with:

```
‚úÖ I have read all 3 documents and understand:

1. Current State:
   - What's working: [list 5-7 working features]
   - What's not working: [list 3-5 broken/placeholder features]
   - Database status: [PostgreSQL/Convex status]

2. Tech Stack:
   - Frontend: [Next.js version, React version, styling]
   - Backend: [Express vs Convex, which is being used]
   - AI Integration: [What's currently working]
   - Authentication: [How it works, test credentials]

3. Implementation Plan:
   - I will build [X] requirements using real implementation
   - I will build [Y] requirements using smart mocks
   - I will start with requirement #[number] because [reason]

4. Critical Rules I Will Follow:
   - ‚úÖ Check CODEBASE-ARCHITECTURE.md before building anything
   - ‚úÖ Don't rebuild what already works
   - ‚úÖ Add loading states everywhere (500ms-2s)
   - ‚úÖ Use believable mock data
   - ‚úÖ Test in browser frequently

Ready to proceed: YES/NO
```

**DO NOT START CODING YET.** Wait for me to confirm your understanding is correct.

## üéØ STEP 3: IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

Once I confirm your understanding, you will:

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (2 hours)
Start with these because they're mostly UI work:
- [x] Requirement #10: Move Intelligence content to Institutional Memory tab (dashboard now hosts intelligence cards only)
- [x] Requirement #11: Fix "View Details" button (rich modal with export/share actions)
- [x] Requirement #9: Add charts to Dashboard (Recharts analytics suite with live mock data)
- [x] Requirement #13, #18, #20: Remove Institutional Memory from tabs (routing cleaned up)

### Phase 2: Core Features (4 hours)
Build the most important functionality:
- [ ] Requirement #3: Intelligence tab chat app with conversations
- [ ] Requirement #2: Functional global search
- [ ] Requirement #5: Dashboard data from database (enhance NISR)
- [ ] Requirement #7: Functional recent activity
- [ ] Requirement #6: Quick Actions buttons

### Phase 3: Opportunities Tab (2 hours)
Complete all opportunities features:
- [ ] Requirement #14: Advanced Filters, Watchlist, Export
- [ ] Requirement #15: Search with Intelligence integration
- [ ] Requirement #16: Express Interest & Download Prospectus
- [ ] Requirement #17: Functional filters

### Phase 4: Smart Mocks (2 hours)
Use believable fake data for complex features:
- [ ] Requirement #4: AI Usage Tracking (enhance existing Settings page)
- [ ] Requirement #12: Apply Lessons button
- [ ] Requirement #19: Strategic Recommendations
- [ ] Requirement #21: Ministry action buttons
- [ ] Requirement #22: Generate Briefing (SHOWPIECE FEATURE)

### Phase 5: Polish (1 hour)
Final touches:
- [ ] Requirement #8: Navigation from Generate Insights
- [ ] Add loading states everywhere
- [ ] Test complete demo flow
- [ ] Fix any broken interactions

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Check before building:** Always search codebase first
   ```bash
   # Before building a component:
   grep -r "component-name" src/

   # Before building an API endpoint:
   grep -r "endpoint-name" server/
   ```

2. **Follow existing patterns:** Copy working code
   - Login form pattern ‚Üí Use for other forms
   - Intelligence modules ‚Üí Use for other dashboard cards
   - AI assistant ‚Üí Use for tab chat apps

3. **Add loading states everywhere:**
   ```typescript
   const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)

   async function handleAction() {
     setIsLoading(true)
     await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000)) // Simulate delay
     // Do work
     setIsLoading(false)
     toast.success('Done!')
   }
   ```

4. **Use realistic mock data:**
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ GOOD
   const mockProjects = [
     { name: 'Rural Electrification Phase 3', ministry: 'Infrastructure', budget: 2100000000 },
     { name: 'ICT Digital Transformation', ministry: 'ICT', budget: 800000000 },
     // ... 8 more varied examples
   ]

   // ‚ùå BAD
   const mockProjects = [
     { name: 'Project 1', budget: 100 },
     { name: 'Project 2', budget: 200 }
   ]
   ```

5. **Test frequently:** Open browser after each feature
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   cd server && node index.js

   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   npm run dev

   # Browser: http://localhost:3000
   # Login: minister@gov.rw / password123
   ```

### ‚ùå DON'T:
1. **Don't rebuild working features**
   - Check CODEBASE-ARCHITECTURE.md first
   - Search codebase before building

2. **Don't connect database**
   - PostgreSQL schema exists but DON'T connect it
   - Use localStorage or in-memory data for demo

3. **Don't deploy Convex**
   - Convex files exist but DON'T deploy
   - Frontend tries to use it but falls back to Express (this is OK)

4. **Don't change core files unless necessary**
   - `server/index.js` - Leave alone
   - `src/app/page.tsx` - Only modify if adding new views
   - `src/lib/auth.tsx` - Don't touch
   - `server/routes/auth.js` - Don't touch

5. **Don't spend time on:**
   - Production-grade error handling
   - Edge case handling
   - Database setup
   - Real email sending
   - Complex validation
